      <h2>👋 Chairman's Opening Remarks</h2>
      <div class="highlight" style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 4px solid #ccc;">
        <p><strong>A message from our Club Chairman, Marc Preece</strong></p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the inaugural edition of our monthly newsletter! As your chairman, I am thrilled to launch this platform that will celebrate the achievements, stories, and spirit of our incredible triathlon community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club has just this year marked its 5-year anniversary, and what our members have achieved over that time is truly remarkable—from new friendships formed, to first triathlons, duathlons and some who completed truly audacious physical challenges like Celtman or an Ironman—each and every one of you should be proud.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d also like to thank the committee and coaches, who behind the scenes are doing all they can for the betterment of the club. We have recently received feedback to tailor our swim sessions, where we have listened and made crucial changes to support our members—unfortunately this has not seen an increase in numbers and the club is losing money with swim pool charges and insufficient members attending. We will monitor this over the coming months and we do hope to see you back swimming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This month we reflect on June 2025, where we had members racing internationally, locally and we held an adventurous club ride to the islands. We do plan to organise more of these in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this newsletter you will find links to inspiring stories from fellow members, updates on upcoming events, and tips to enhance your training. Our goal is to foster a sense of camaraderie and engagement among all members, encouraging everyone to share their experiences and achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for everyone to relish the benefits of the club I encourage you all to actively participate and engage with fellow members, whether it's formal training or ad hoc training within the club—all will support your goals I am sure. Together, we can create a vibrant, thriving community that motivates and inspires each other to reach new heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, enjoy the summer month of July and any holidays you may have planned. Let’s make this journey unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let’s be truly awesome…
        </p>
        <p>Yours in Tri</p>
        <p><em>– Marc, Club Chairman</em></p>

      <h2>📣 Coaches’ Corner</h2>
      <p><em>Insights from Marc, Stevie, Chris, and Stuart</em></p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Swimming isn’t just about fitness—it’s about technique. You can be the fittest athlete on the start line, but without efficient form, you’re working twice as hard for half the gain.”</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Marc’s advice? Focus on body position, breathing, drills—and, most importantly, consistency week after week. The speed will follow. 🏊‍♂️</p>
